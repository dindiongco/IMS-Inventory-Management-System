# Inventory Management System

This Project was to create an Inventory Management System application using Java and MySQL. Java was used as a Back-end programming language that creates an application that can connect to a database in MySQL and make changes there. 

## Getting Started

To use this application, clone the repository into a local folder and run the application from the ims-0.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar file using the java -jar command. 

### Prerequisites

You will need at least Java 1.8 and MySQL Server 5.7+ (local or GCP instance).





## Running the tests

By opening the file in a Java IDE and then running JUnit test on the source folder. 

### Unit Tests 

Unit is a testing approach that targets each unit of a block of code and tests their functionality. Unit tests are essential in that it allows the developer in finding potential problems prior to release. Testing is essential to provide quality assurance.
